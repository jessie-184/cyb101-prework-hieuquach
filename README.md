**My App Idea: **
I want to build a neighborhood app. The app provides users with a real-time updated calendar that they can use to keep track of what is going on within the neighborhood. People can also utilize the app as a lost-and-found space. If you want to learn more about any historical stories or know more about who is around you, you can find the information on my neighborhood app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
